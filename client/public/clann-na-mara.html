  <h1>Clann na Mara</h1>

  <p><strong>Clann na Mara</strong> is a Gaelic surf and ocean culture club for children in Eilean Siar. Through surf games, nature learning, and play, we help kids build confidence, learn water safety, and form a lifelong connection to the sea. All activities are bilingual and rooted in community values, promoting a love for nature and the protection of our coastline. To be a part of Clann na Mara you don’t have to be born here, but you better respect the ocean and it's people here.</p>

  <p>This grassroots initiative is designed to connect young children — especially those in remote Gaelic speaking communities — with the natural marine environment through engaging, fun, and safe beach-based activities.</p>

  <p>We aim to build ocean awareness and resilience, social and environmental responsibility, and personal wellbeing by introducing children (ages ~6) to the joys of ocean play, surf safety, and coastal morphology. Through a 3-day nature-based program of surf games, beach challenges, creative learning, competition, and storytelling in both Gaelic and English, children will develop physical confidence, mental resilience, and increase their bond with the ocean.</p>
  
  <p> We are planning a GROM SQUAD SURF CLUB with a 3-DAY SCHEDULE over the summer, with potential to grow and develop</p>

  <p>We would like to be able to have a small team to run the event and to be able to acquire equipment suitable for young children, including foam boards, balance tools, lifejackets, and wetsuits. Modern wetsuits are extremely flexible and light and insulate the wearer from the elements, meaning that beach activities could be conducted in all weather conditions.</p>

  <p>The club will be delivered in close collaboration with <strong>Spòrsnis</strong> in Ness and <strong>Stornoway Karate Club</strong>.</p>

  <p>By delivering the project entirely within the Outer Hebrides using aelic, we will also celebrate and strengthen Gaelic cultural identity through the language of the sea. Clann na Mara is a safe, positive space where children and families connect to nature, community, and heritage.</p>

  <p>The long-term vision is to run seasonal versions of this club: 1) helping build a generation of young people empowered to manage and enjoy their ocean resources, 2) developing confident, capable ocean people, and 3) strengthening Gaelic stewardship of the island’s world-class wave resources.</p>

<p> The provisional schedule</p>

  <h2>🏄‍♂️ GROM SQUAD SURF CLUB: 3-DAY SCHEDULE</h2>

  <p><strong>Community-led Surf Club</strong> – All children must be accompanied by a parent or responsible adult. Every child will need a wetsuit for beach activities. A lifejacket is recommended for added safety, but not required, as children won’t be entering water beyond their depth.</p>

  <p><strong>Ages ~6 | Fun-focused, beginner-friendly, confidence-building</strong></p>
